This assisgnment is arranged as follows - 

 - Questions 1 to 5 have been solved in individual files with the corresponding names. Wherever there is interdependency between the files, appropriate import    calls have been made
 - Question 6 has been placed in a separate folder with its data and separate readme file. This file outlines the structure of the solution as well as the       external library required to run it
 - Question 7's solution is present in the PDF file of the corresponding name. This contains the explanation as well as the diagram for the solution

 - Test cases have been checked for Questions 1 - 5
	- For Questions 2 - 5, these can be run using pytest
        - for Question 1, the test cases are implemented in a normal program with the expected outputs highlighted via comments for appropriate blocks of code

Instructions to run the programs - 

 - (For Q1 - Q5): Run the correspondingly named python files
 - (For Q6): Open the folder for the file and check the Readme file placed inside for further instructions
 - To test Q2 - Q5, run pytest for the file named Q2toQ5_tests
 - To test Q1, run the program named Q1_tests

Comments about the Test Cases - 

The cases presented here are limited but demonstrate the robustness of the programs within the scope of the assignment. I wanted to implement more general test cases but fell short of time. These cases still serve to highlight possible edge cases for their corresponding programs.
